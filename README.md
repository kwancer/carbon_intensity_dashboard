# carbon_intensity_dashboard

## About
Built for Android. 
Displays the current carbon intensity as well as if it is High/Medium/Low based on the current day range.
Displays the graph for the current day with actual data when available and predicted data for the rest of the day.
I  matched the colour scheme to the Tewke website.

## Assumptions
Only need to refresh data when the app is first loaded.


## Future Improvements
Fix the legend to show a dashed line for predicted data.
Improve the hover to not overlap between the actual data and predicted data.
Add a refresh option when swipped down.
Fix problems within the code.
Improve the way that the theming is done by using a more structured approach.
